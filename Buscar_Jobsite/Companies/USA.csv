To achieve that mission, the Air Force has a vision of Global Vigilance, Reach and Power. That vision orbits around three core competencies: developing Airmen, technology to war fighting and integrating operations. These core competencies make our six distinctive capabilities possible.

Air and Space Superiority: With it, joint forces can dominate enemy operations in all dimensions: land, sea, air and space.

Global Attack: Because of technological advances, the Air Force can attack anywhere, anytime and do so quickly and with greater precision than ever before.

Rapid Global Mobility: Being able to respond quickly and decisively anywhere we're needed is key to maintaining rapid global mobility.

Precision Engagement: The essence lies in the ability to apply selective force against specific targets because the nature and variety of future contingencies demand both precise and reliable use of military power with minimal risk and collateral damage.

Information Superiority: The ability of joint force commanders to keep pace with information and incorporate it into a campaign plan is crucial.

Agile Combat Support: Deployment and sustainment are keys to successful operations and cannot be separated. Agile combat support applies to all forces, from those permanently based to contingency buildups to expeditionary",3,0,"-Jobsite needs log in https://prnt.sc/svVMm770XytV

Whether helping clients navigate the home buying process or creating new financial products, you join an organization that’s changing the face of lending – just as we have for over 30 years. What began as a summer experiment has become America’s largest mortgage lender,* with offices in Detroit, Cleveland, Phoenix and more. Over 17,000 professionals work for our suite of fintech services. Along with nearly 100 brands across industries from real estate to sports, we form the Rock Family of Companies – united by an obsession to find a better way for our clients, team members and communities.

It’s more than an obsession, though. It’s also our purpose. Finding a better way is the only way. The results are clear:
• We were the first lender to bring the mortgage process online.
• For 8 years in a row, J.D. Power ranked Quicken Loans highest in the nation in customer satisfaction for Primary Mortgage Origination. And for the fifth year in a row, they ranked us highest for Mortgage Servicing.**
• We develop technology that improves lives, like integrations that let you pay a mortgage using your voice.

This wouldn’t be possible without our team members. Their drive has led us to the top-30 of FORTUNE magazine’s ranking of the 100 Best Companies to Work For list 15 years in a row. But awards can’t replace big ideas. That’s why we’re committed to a workplace where every voice is heard and all team members have the opportunity to become the best versions of themselves. That mission goes past our walls and into our communities, where we don’t just volunteer but also invest in ways that impact the world around us. We’ve revolutionized the fintech industry, but this is about more than mortgages. It’s about changing people’s lives. Join our team and change your own today.

These products include galvanized, hot-rolled and cold-finished steel, stainless steel, aluminum, brass, copper, titanium and alloy steel sold to more than 125,000 customers in a broad range of industries. Some of these metals service centers provide processing services for specialty metals only.
 
In the mid-1970's, the Company began to establish specialty metals centers stocked with inventories of selected metals and equipped with automated materials handling and precision cutting equipment.
 
Beginning in the early 1990's, owners of successful service center companies started to sell these companies as they were reaching retirement age. Reliance saw this as an opportunity to expand nationally in a more profitable manner which led the Company to complete an IPO in 1994 to raise the funds to allow for that growth. Reliance has grown significantly through such acquisitions, completing more than 55 acquisitions since their initial public offering in 1994, and will continue to be an aggressive acquirer of companies.

Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. is a Fortune 500 company and has been named to the Fortune list of “The World’s Most Admired Companies” since 2007. 75 years after their humble beginnings, they continue to celebrate, affirm, and encourage their core values, both in their business practices and local communities, keeping their family of companies successful.",3,179,"no jobs

Read on to find out more about our history.

Our company was first established in 1938 in Glasgow, Scotland. At the time, we had just 12 machinists, a 1200 sqft warehouse, and we provided uniforms and other items of clothing to large organisations, including the local police. As our success grew, we started to manufacture a new product that would come to shape our business for the next 70 years. That product, was anoraks and other waterproof jackets.

As our business grew, so did our surroundings. We moved from our small warehouse to a new location on Glasgow’s Argyll Street, in 1977. We had more than 10,000 sqft of office and warehouse space, from which we continued to design and manufacture outdoor clothing.

During the 1980s, our business rapidly expanded. We started an import and export branch of the company, which sold our specialist outdoor clothing to countries around the world. This was an exciting time for us, and we saw our production rates increase and our staff levels grow.

In 1984, as our client list expanded, we decided to create a dedicated brand that would provide only the finest, high performance, quality outdoor clothing; Trespass was born. We started to focus on affordable skiwear and other specialist outdoor clothing and equipment, such as waterproof jackets and walking boots. We have a huge passion for the outdoors and we wanted to show that through our product line.

During the 1990s, we decided to open retail stores, which would sell our Trespass branded clothing and accessories. While we started with just a few select stores, we now have more than 170 stores across the UK. In addition to this, we are in the process of opening stores in mainland Europe and even further afield in the likes of America and Asia.

Today we are one of the UK's most successful outdoor clothing retailers.",3,0,"[11/16/2022] CL Mant, jobs in indeed, https://uk.indeed.com/trespass-jobs?vjk=4fedac5ff5433362",,,,,,,0,null,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHz2bA962O9ow/company-logo_100_100/0/1552401043364?e=1675296000&v=beta&t=sHJJR874tfFaiHK-Wh4CXGsx88ue8RXo0uRB7H3fiak,1228,1668620489,0,9999,"2022-10-31 00:00:00",1679577794,1070,Retail,0,[],[],

MedMen brings class leading operational expertise and unprecedented investment to the fast changing and fast-growing cannabis industry as it moves from its gray market legacy to a fully regulated, legitimate and commercially viable market.

Based in Los Angeles, MedMen employs over 1,100 team members across the U.S. It was founded in 2010 by Adam Bierman and Andrew Modlin, two visionary entrepreneurs who saw not just a tremendous business opportunity in the growing legalization of marijuana, but a chance to redefine our society's relationship with cannabis. The federal prohibition has had a disastrous impact, overpopulating our prisons and enriching violent drug cartels while keeping a relatively benign substance with proven benefits out of the reach of law abiding citizens.

MedMen supports sensible, clear and just drug laws that strengthen communities and create economic opportunities. The company is the single largest financial supporter of progressive marijuana laws at the local, state and federal levels, giving directly to pro-legalization groups, industry organizations and political candidates.

The Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) is an agency within the Texas Health and Human Services System.

  they may qualify.
- Better integrates programs by removing bureaucratic silos and grouping similar 
  programs and services together.
- Creates clear lines of accountability within the organization.
- Includes well-defined and objective performance metrics for all organizational 
  areas.

Texas Health and Human Services now consists of 2 agencies: the Texas Health and Human Services Commission and the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). HHS is headquartered in Austin, TX.

Currently, campus housing accommodates students in both apartment and residential suite style facilities.

The faculty and staff provide collaborative relationships with students and an education that fosters ethical exploration, civic engagement, social responsibility, and global awareness combined with a solid foundation in an academic discipline. Many classes average fewer than 40 students, allowing close interaction between students and faculty.

That’s how we described ourselves in 1997, and that mission hasn’t changed and will never, ever change. For over two decades we’ve worked to make the Alamo Drafthouse experience the best cinematic experience in the world. Here’s how.

We don’t just want to be another multiplex. Everyone who works at Alamo Drafthouse, from the managers to the servers to the kitchen staff, is passionate about film.

To us, the latest entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe can be just as worthy of attention and celebration as a foreign language drama. Through our Drafthouse Recommends program we've committed ourselves to helping innovative and challenging films like GET OUT, THE FLORIDA PROJECT,  and CALL ME BY YOUR NAME, and find an audience.

Celebrating classic cinema is also something we take seriously. Whether it’s an interactive Movie Party presentation of a timeless classic, a chef-inspired feast with a menu paired to a film, or a re-evaluation of a lost gem, we love sharing the movies we love with Alamo Drafthouse audiences of all ages.

When you see a movie at Alamo Drafthouse, you get cold drinks, delicious meals and tasty local beers, brought to your seat by a server. Need a free refill on your popcorn or soda? Raise an order card and we’ll get it taken care of quickly.

Each Alamo Drafthouse's menu has food, snacks & dessert prepared fresh from locally sourced ingredients. Plus, our chefs regularly create special menus inspired by classic cinema and big upcoming blockbusters, like an all-Pakistani menu curated by Kumail Nanjiani for THE BIG SICK or a take on African flavors for BLACK PANTHER.

Beer is our middle name at Alamo Drafthouse, so we make certain that every Alamo Drafthouse location highlights and promotes the best local craft breweries. Our bar staff also loves to innovate, and are constantly mixing up new cocktail creations that’ll elevate the cinematic experience.",4,0,"[01/07/2022]to apply to the job you must fill out the form,https://prnt.sc/26ba0bk",,,,,,,0,null,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQHXu0uMuj1nmg/company-logo_400_400/0/1654630066672?e=1677715200&v=beta&t=so7ewW8m8C46_o_XndrrbkIqutWqxoOiL1QtwFad-i8,740,1649173484,0,9999,"2022-11-25 00:00:00",1679585636,1070,"Entertainment Providers",0,[],[],

Today, it is one of the top-25 medical schools in the country and both the #1 medical school and largest biomedical research institution in Ohio. It has nearly two dozen program and degree options for prospective students, including the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine at Case Western Reserve University program, and is 14th in the nation for graduating both successful faculty and African American physicians. In 2019, it opened the doors of the new 485,000 square foot Health Education Campus, bringing together multiple health profession students from across the university under one roof to promote interprofessional education and collaborative practice.

Throughout its history, the school pioneered such curricular developments as integrating clinical and basic sciences, requiring original research theses for graduation, introducing students to clinical work in the first year, and establishing the first dual-degree MD/PhD program in the country. By 1865, the school had graduated the third African American to earn an MD from a recognized American medical school, and 6 of the first 7 women to do the same. In the early 1900s, the school was considered one of the top two medical schools in the nation. 

The school is affiliated with 5 top-ranked hospitals, and its research prowess has supported such achievements as the first simulated milk formula for infants, the first heart-lung machine for open-heart surgery, the discovery of BHG PolyA, creation of the first artificial human chromosome, the first stool DNA tests for early detection of colon cancer, and the development of both Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting and the first rapid-detection device for malaria.",3,0,"Has been reviewed.

The center manages many of NASA's Earth observation, astronomy, planetary science and astrophysics missions.

NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is home to the nation's largest organization of scientists, engineers and technologists who build spacecraft, instruments and new technology to study Earth, the sun, our solar system and the universe.

Just outside Washington, Goddard is home to Hubble operations and the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope. Goddard manages communications between mission control and orbiting astronauts aboard the International Space Station. Goddard scientists stare into the sun, grind up meteorites for signs of life's building blocks, look into the farthest reaches of space, and untangle the mysteries of our own changing world. Goddard engineers construct sensitive instruments, build telescopes that peer into the cosmos, and operate the test chambers that ensure those satellites' survival.

Named for American rocketry pioneer Dr. Robert H. Goddard, the center was established May 1, 1959, as NASA's first space flight complex. Goddard and its several installations are critical in carrying out NASA's missions of space exploration and scientific discovery.

Goddard encompasses several other NASA properties, most significantly:

• Wallops Flight Facility near Chincoteague, Virginia
• Katherine Johnson Independent Verification and Validation Facility in Fairmont, West Virginia
• Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City
• White Sands Complex outside Las Cruces, New Mexico

Anomaly has been recognized for a very wide range of work and IP, including: Ad Age's 2017 Agency of the Year, Cannes Lions, Effies, Fast Company's Most Innovative, Jay Chiat, Digiday Awards and the Mashies - among the usual suspects.

As an extension of this belief, Anomaly has joined Pledge Parental Leave (pledgepl.org), a movement uniting creative companies to give parents paid parental leave. Primary caregivers receive six months of paid protected leave as well as uninterrupted medical insurance. Secondary caregivers receive up to three months of paid protected leave. Until there is universal support in the U.S. that recognizes the importance of this support, companies need to lead the way and help tip the scales.

Archbishop Christie named the school “Columbia University” after the mighty river that flowed nearby, and when it opened its doors, it was staffed with priests from the archdiocese.

Columbia University achieved junior college status in 1922, and in 1925 the College of Arts and Sciences was founded. Four years later the first bachelor’s degrees were awarded to a class of seven men. In the 1930s, the University’s name was changed to the University of Portland, the St. Vincent Hospital School of Nursing became part of the University as the College of Nursing, and the School of Business were created. In 1948, the School of Engineering was created. The University established its Graduate School in 1950 and the School of Education in 1962. In 1967 the Congregation of Holy Cross and the University’s Board of Regents transitioned to a shared governance structure. Today, the University continues to be guided by the Congregation of Holy Cross and governed by an independent board of directors. 

The University of Portland is the only school in Oregon to offer a College of Arts & Sciences, a graduate school, and nationally accredited programs in the schools of business, education, engineering, and nursing. In 2013, University of Portland was named one of America's ""Green Colleges""​ for the fourth consecutive year by The Princeton Review.

Baker University was chartered on February 12, 1858. Named for Osmon Cleander Baker, a distinguished scholar and bishop of what is now the United Methodist Church, the school holds the honor of being the first university in Kansas.

Baker graduates have gone on to successful careers as writers, scientists, explorers, teachers, business professionals, performers, politicians, academicians, visionaries, trendsetters and more. Four graduates have been named Rhodes Scholars and one has earned a Pulitzer Prize.

More than a billion people use the internet yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it.

The Agency explicitly reaches for transformational change instead of incremental advances. To do so, it works within an innovation ecosystem that includes academic, corporate and governmental partners, with a constant focus on the Nation’s military Services, which work with DARPA to create new strategic opportunities and novel tactical options.

DARPA comprises approximately 220 government employees in six technical offices, including nearly 100 program managers, who together oversee about 250 research and development programs.

DARPA goes to great lengths to identify, recruit and support excellent program managers—extraordinary individuals who are at the top of their fields and are hungry for the opportunity to push the limits of their disciplines. These leaders, who are at the very heart of DARPA’s history of success, come from academia, industry and government agencies for limited stints, generally three to five years. That deadline fuels the signature DARPA urgency to achieve success in less time than might be considered reasonable in a conventional setting.

Program managers address challenges broadly, spanning the spectrum from deep science to systems to capabilities, but ultimately they are driven by the desire to make a difference. They define their programs, set milestones, meet with their performers and assiduously track progress. But they are also constantly probing for the next big thing in their fields, communicating with leaders in the scientific and engineering community to identify new challenges and potential solutions. 

DARPA is always on the lookout for outstanding individuals who can meet our demanding needs in the Agency’s technical and support offices.

Together, with his wife Jeanette, they embellished the Brady family name and created the now-famous Beef 'O'​ Brady’s®. Their first restaurant opened in Brandon, Florida. The regulars quickly nicknamed it ""Beef ’s®.""​ 

Inspired by a love of sports, Jim filled his restaurant with TVs and satellite dishes so patrons could enjoy watching a vast array of sporting events. He also covered the walls with authentic sports memorabilia he had collected through the years. As a final touch, he made sure a traditional Irish Blessing graced every menu, bidding good fortune and happy times to all who visited. 

As the Beef's® story grew, so too did the menu. It was important to Jim that guests have variety (like the award-winning wings available in 12 signature sauces) as well as signature favorites with an Irish twist. 

Today, Beef 'O'​ Brady’s® is one of the fastest growing restaurants in the country. Some call it the ""Luck of the Irish.""​ Jim would call it a darn good dream that took a lot of hard work.",4,0,"214757

This is only possible because of the incredible agents we work with every day who provide our Funeral Advantage products to our valued senior customers. Our agents come from all walks of life – some have decades of experience and some have none! Whatever your background, Lincoln Heritage is excited you’re here. We want to partner with you to represent and distribute our revolutionary final expense insurance product, the Funeral Advantage Program, to the expanding senior market. The time has never been better to start selling final expense insurance. The market has seen unprecedented growth and doesn’t show any signs of stopping.

Lincoln Heritage Life Insurance Company was founded in 1963 — a time when final expense insurance claims could take several months to be paid to policyholders. Meanwhile, the concept of fast overnight claims payment and 24-hour service for both agents and customers was more fiction than fact. As such, our founding mission for our company and our Funeral Advantage Program for seniors was to set a new bar for prompt, friendly, and accurate service in the life insurance industry.

Lincoln Heritage Life Insurance Company has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau and an A- (Excellent) rating with A.M. Best, an organization that evaluates the financial strength of insurance companies. We’ve also received hundreds of positive reviews over the years from Funeral Advantage policyholder families who have experienced our fast claims service.

Commonly referred to as burial insurance or funeral insurance, Lincoln Heritage Life Insurance Company provides final expense life insurance quotes for people looking to protect their families from rising funeral costs.

It includes the Behavioral Health Services Department, Public Health Department, Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, Emergency Medical Services Agency, Custody Health Department, and Valley Health Plan. 

We are dedicated to the health and well-being of all residents of our county. Here are just a few of our recent accomplishments.

• Santa Clara Valley Medical Center was the first hospital in nation to treat a spinal cord injury patient with 20 million stem cells. This made the Rehabilitation Center a front-runner in clinical research aimed at curing paralysis.
• To provide life-saving skills to the community, the Emergency Medical Services Agency held public education sessions throughout the county. Over 775 people were trained in life-saving interventions like hands-only CPR.
• The Public Health Department responded to and controlled 85 infectious disease outbreaks, including measles, norovirus, and Shigella. Controlling outbreaks limits the spread of disease in our community. EMS Agency conducted 6 public education sessions and trained 775 people in life-saving interventions.

• Behavioral Health Services ran a successful campaign encouraging middle aged men (highest suicide rate in SCC) to seek help. During the campaign, the percentage of calls from men to Suicide and Crisis Hotline doubled. More men in our community got the support they needed. 
• The first surplus medication redistribution pharmacy in CA, the Better Health Pharmacy provided free prescriptions to over 1,450 residents this year. The program continues to grow, getting more people the medications then need.
• As the lowest cost Covered California health plan in our county, Valley Health Plan’s Individual & Family Plan grew 237% over last year. More people with insurance and access to care leads to a healthier community. 
• Valley Health Center Downtown opened and brought a wide-range of healthcare services to the downtown San Jose community. Since opening, 9,264 patients in 15,437 visits have be cared for at Valley Health Center Downtown.

What may be more obscure is the fascinating story of the company’s unique heritage, which began with a Holocaust survivor and her family caring for seniors out of their University City home. Over the past 50 years, the company has blossomed into a trusted, family-owned St. Louis based company.  The late Barbara Grossberg, Delmar Gardens’ founder and spiritual leader, learned to care for the elderly during her adolescence in Hungary, where her early “playmates” were seniors recuperating at her father’s clinic. She was told to love and respect her elders because, she was reminded that “They have already lived a lifetime.”  However, Barbara’s childhood was cut short by the Nazi invasion, and by age 13, she would find herself at Auschwitz and later Bergen-Belsen and Dachau.
After the war, Mrs. Grossberg returned to Budapest and met Henry Grossberg. The couple married and had two children, George and Gabe. When the USSR invaded Hungary, the family left their home in the middle of the night and eventually made their way to University City, where Barbara began caring for seniors. 
Barbara and Henry’s visionary patient care and management expertise led to a successful partnership with the late Israel and Yetra Goldberg in 1965.  Based on the resounding success of their first skilled facility in University City, Delmar Gardens Enterprises was formed.
The company has been growing ever since, filling the needs in senior healthcare services ranging from retirement, assisted living, skilled nursing centers, rehab, home health, private duty, hospice, medical equipment, respiratory care, wound care and pharmacy services.  In addition to St. Louis, Delmar Gardens provides healthcare services to over 4,000 seniors in Missouri, Kansas, Georgia, Nebraska, Illinois, and Nevada.
Since 1993, Barbara’s son Gabe Grossberg has served as Delmar Gardens’ President and CEO.",3,0,"[01/26/2022] The page contains jobsite but it is down.https://prnt.sc/26k3ryk",,,,,,,0,null,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQF7mdsrAQrBBw/company-logo_100_100/0/1550172787826?e=1675296000&v=beta&t=G-2yV99-wiTrpb7HYtj5JU5NK-Qr9GMS--o-MDJD3HY,740,1649173573,0,9999,"2022-10-28 00:00:00",1679577794,1070,"Hospitals and Health Care",0,[],[],

Despite his best attempts to make his facilities beautiful, he frequently would hear residents wishing they could live at home. What resulted was an organization that could allow them to do just that…

CareGivers America opened in 2002. Its mission was seemingly simple: Keep people home. With those three words in mind, the founders began hiring caregivers to provide in-home personal care and homemaker services. As the years progressed, they found that to keep people home, they needed to offer more than just non-medical services. What evolved was a company that could meet ALL of a consumer’s home care needs, no matter their age, diagnosis, or their ability to pay for services.

Today, the company offers CareGiver/Homemaker services, Home Health Nursing and Therapy, Medical Supplies, Home Adaptations/Modifications and more!

In 2015, CareGivers America became part of the Simplura Health Group, a larger organization with operations in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Florida. In the Pennsylvania market, the company continues to operate as ‘CareGivers America’. 

In November 2020 Simplura Health Group was honored to announce that it has joined The Providence Service Corporation family, the nation’s largest manager of non-emergency medical transportation programs for state governments and managed care organizations. In the words of Providence CEO Daniel Greenleaf, this transformative coming together, ""unifies two social-determinants-of-health pioneers that share a common mission, that provide value-based care and solutions to similar vulnerable patient populations.""

But always and unwavering, CareGivers America, from its humble beginnings to its now industry leading position in home healthcare, still prides itself on understanding the needs of its dedicated staff and always remembering its founding mission: Keep People Home.",3,0,"18/08/2021

Notable initiatives include the Livable City Initiative, begun in 1996, which promotes home ownership and removes blight.  In 1995, DeStefano launched a 15-year, $1.5 billion School Construction Program, already half finished, to replace or renovate every New Haven public school. In 2010 DeStefano began the ambitious job of undertaking school reform efforts - which led to the NY Times referring to New Haven as ""ground zero""​ for school reform.",3,0,"[2022-04-25] It worked with the CL maintenance strategy, it was identified that the company no longer has a jobsite, the scanid: 217721 was inactivated and the CL company was classified as no_jobsite.",,,,,,,0,null,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQENtkIKTLZDLQ/company-logo_100_100/0/1593308019767?e=1675296000&v=beta&t=hHNpEgsb1SPGhyPgC9CcMQsygWtvnK1jGcJr_QIdqp4,1328,1650906885,0,9999,"2022-10-28 00:00:00",1679577794,1070,"Government Administration",0,[],[],

The office's functions are described in the Illinois Constitution, mainly addressing the Secretary of State's duty to maintain official state records and the state seal. However, law and tradition have assigned many additional responsibilities to the office, which has one of the largest and most diverse collections of responsibilities of any of its counterparts nationwide. These duties are divided among 20 departments employing approximately 4,000 people, whose responsibilities range from maintaining the 20 buildings in the Capitol Complex, to overseeing the state's network of libraries, to preserving some of the state's most precious historical documents.

Still, to many Illinois citizens, the Secretary of State's office is the place to go for a new driver's license or license plates.

""We just enjoyed showing people how to accessorize,"" explains Misty. But what began as a whim was clearly filling a need.

Women flocked to buy accessories that were trendy, but not to intimidating. Classic, but never boring. And best of all, incredibly affordable. At just $5 per piece, Paparazzi Accessories became an invitation to experiment with color, try a more daring style, and do it without risk of buyer's regret. Paparazzi made fashionable finds accessible for every outfit, for every age group, and for every sense of style. The company grew 900% in just six months. 

Today, the concept of ""accessibility"" extends to the very mission of Paparazzi. Accessories are sold exclusively through Paparazzi Consultants, and anyone who wishes to sell the line can do it for themselves. The result is a flourishing business that empowers women and builds self-assurance with a fun financial future.

Paparazzi Founders Misty and Trent Kirby, and Chani and Ryan Reeve, continue to expand the company with hands-on leadership and clear purpose. They individually design and source materials for Paparazzi products while working directly with manufacturing partners to create the fashion-forward results.  

Paparazzi Accessories is based in Southern Utah. For more information or to find a Consultant in your area, please visit paparazziaccessories.com.",3,0,"[08/09/2021 En el momento de inspeccionar el homepage no se le encuentra el careersite]

Hartford’s system of schools exists to provide all students with access to participation in a global economy through attainment of Academic Standards of the State of Connecticut and readiness for post-secondary education.

Vision

Hartford Public Schools is a system of high performing, distinctive schools of choice. The attainment of Hartford students in reading, math, science, and college readiness will reflect the high educational outcomes of the State of Connecticut.






Strategy

The District will employ a “Balanced” theory of action for reform governance linked to the organizational structure of an “all-choice” system of schools.

 

A balanced theory of action is the most promising strategy relative to Hartford Public Schools’ current operating environment and will advantage the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of the Managed Instruction and Performance Empowerment theories of change. Using this strategy, the District will define its relationship with each school on the basis of performance.

•Relatively high performing and/or significantly improving schools will be given considerable programmatic autonomy and freedom from bureaucratic operational constraints.
•Chronically low performing schools that fail to improve will be subject to district intervention, redesign, closure or replacement with higher performing school models.
•Schools in the mid-range will be provided with “defined autonomy” relative to program and operations to build their capacity for improvement.

 

Using a diverse provider strategy, Hartford Public Schools will evolve over time to a total system of choice schools. Two choice models will be employed.",3,0,,,,,,,,0,null,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",740,1649173573,0,9999,"2022-10-31 00:00:00",1679577794,1070,"Primary and Secondary Education",0,[],[],

With more than 1,300 associates and a network of branches from coast to coast, North American Title Group, LLC (NATG) is among the largest real estate settlement service providers in the U.S. Consisting of both agent and underwriter operations, NATG reported annual net revenues in fiscal 2017 of $272.7 million. The company also has the resources and stability of a wholly owned subsidiary of an S&P 500 company with over $18.7 billion in assets as of its fiscal year ended Nov. 30, 2017. North American Title’s agency network operates nationally under the name North American Title Co. and similar names (NATC) in 19 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Virginia, in addition to the District of Columbia. Through its relationship with an expanding affiliate network, NATC provides real estate settlement services in all 50 states. NATG is headquartered in Miami, Florida. 

Since NATC is not a direct operation of any one national title insurance underwriter, NATC has the unique ability to be an agent for all such major national title insurance underwriters, including North American’s affiliate underwriter, North American Title Insurance Company (NATIC). This ensures our customers receive the best title insurance products available throughout the entire industry at the best possible rates.

inDriver is committed to promoting fairness and equity in its markets. Its model allows users to get the best deals on rides and other mobility services. inDriver's proposition is that passengers determine the price of the trip rather than algorithms. The passenger inputs the amount he or she is willing to pay for the trip, while nearby drivers can choose to accept or ignore the request or offer a different price. inDriver’s app also offers intercity, cargo, and freight, as well as delivery services.

inDriver started as a response to a cartel of taxis in the northern city of Yakutsk doubling their fares when temperatures fell to freezing levels. Locals set up an Independent Drivers community through a social network, where people posted ride requests and input the price they were willing to pay. Drivers then picked up the requests. The group was soon replaced by a stand-alone app called inDriver, which operated on the same principle. 

In 2012, inDriver launched BeginIT, a social education project aimed at providing career guidance in the field of new technologies to talented children from orphanages, boarding, and rural schools. As of 2022, the project operates in 12 countries around the world. Participating youths receive a free one-year distance learning course in programming basics. Participating schools are provided with assistance in equipping computer classrooms and programming clubs. inDriver also frequently arranges tours and master classes for schoolchildren in company offices.

Recently named “among the top schools in the world” by the Johns Hopkins CTY, we help children of all levels excel in mathematics. At RSM, we believe all children are capable of developing a solid foundation in math if it's taught correctly.
 
By guiding our students to derive new concepts based on those they learned before, we promote understanding over memorization. Algebra is introduced in elementary school when kids are best at grasping abstract concepts.

We ask our youngest students to become thinkers and analysts, encouraging them to discover solutions and reflect on how they reached that solution. Because of this approach, when our students are confronted with any problem they don't recognize, they don't back down. Instead, they consider different ways they might tackle it.

All of our teachers have a degree in mathematics or a related field. Most importantly, all RSM teachers have a deep love for mathematics. Our team of curriculum experts use their wealth of classroom experience and strong academic background to continuously advance RSM's curriculum and teaching methods. 

Math empowers the mind for independent thought. Whether it's excelling on a test, getting into a top university, or succeeding in any career, math is what gets you there.

If he could lay out great ranch-style steaks, in a place where anybody and everybody could lean back and enjoy themselves, then maybe they'd come back and try it again. That year, he opened the first Black Angus Steakhouse.

At the time, when a steakhouse meant a stuffy place where you spent a week's paycheck, the idea seemed a bit wobbly. But it took, and we've stuck to it. Since 1964 Black Angus has served a lot of great steak to a lot of hungry Guests in a comfortable setting that's easy to be at and hard to leave.

All of our steaks are Black Angus beef, aged a minimum of 21 days for maximum tenderness and depth of flavor. We carefully hand-cut them to get to the freshest, tastiest beef. We grill them over an open flame to sear in that under-the-stars, over-the-campfire flavor. Just before they come off the fire, we brush them with our own seasoned butter to give them the extra richness that separates our steaks from the other guys.

We know man does not live by steak alone, so you can team your steak up with lobster tail or grilled prawns or fried shrimp. Or go with some terrific chicken or salmon or salads. Once you make the tough decision on the entrée, your work is still not done. You get to choose from a list of 16 craveable sidekicks, like a wedge salad, or a loaded baked potato, to name just a few. There's almost too many choices.

Our commitment to hospitality staffing has earned the trust and respect of the best hotel brands in the business, including four and five-diamond properties. We attribute this, in part, to the fact that each member of our management team has worked in and around the hotel industry. They understand the pressure to provide superior service while cutting costs, and work daily to deliver just such a solution.

Recruiting superior talent is equally responsible for our success. Grassroots recruiting allows us to carefully screen for the proper attitude, skill sets, and work ethic. Clients and guests note our associates’ diligence and care. 

All personnel are Hospitality Staffing Solutions employees, so we have a different relationship with them. We offer entry-level positions with the opportunity to advance into supervisory or managerial roles, but we expect professional and ethical behavior in return. And because Hospitality Staffing Solutions takes care of our employees— providing consistent hours, bi-weekly payroll, health care insurance options, workers compensation, and inspired leadership —employees tend to stay with us. 

Our model offers clients the continuity of full time employees with the scalability of flexible staffing.

In addition to accepting most insurance plans, Kool Smiles is proud to offer care to families seeking a State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) or Medicaid dentist. Kool Smiles also provides oral health education programs through partnerships with community schools and organizations. 

The alarming state of oral health today is the foundation upon which Kool Smiles has built its mission and vision. Despite the United States’ status as the wealthiest country, the U.S. Surgeon General concluded that oral care is the #1 unmet healthcare need for children.  Over 50 percent of 5- to 9-year-old children have at least one cavity or filling, and that proportion increases to 78 percent among 17-year-olds.  Oral health is essential to the general health and well-being of children and plays a critical role in their ability to succeed in school and acquire positive self-esteem.

For a low monthly fee of less than $25, the Company's legal expense plans (referred to as memberships) offer a variety of legal services. Plus the best when it comes to Identity Theft protection 

A LegalShield Legal plans give members access to professional legal counsel not only for trivial legal problems, but for the traumatic ones, like everyday events such as buying a house or a car, creating a will, handling a problem with an insurance company, dealing with identity theft, and much more where legal review should be routine, but rarely is. These events can be among the most important events in a person's life, yet there is a tendency for them to take place without proper legal review. For our members, access to legal counsel is only a toll-free phone call away. 

We offer our legal plans to families, small business owners, and to employees of companys as a voluntary benefit through payroll deduction added as an enhancement to their compensation benefits package.
 
In addition, we offer a superior Identity Theft product, which in combination with our legal plan creates a wall of security that is unsurpassed in the industry to fight the growing issue of identity theft. In accordance with federal laws affecting employers, we also provide our clients with an option to enroll in a Premium Identity Theft Plan.

Ecole Primaire is the brainchild of Montreal native Anita Da Silva, the daughter of a Portuguese seamstress who loved to overdress her in tulle and ruffles.

This may be done to hide information from competitors, or — as part of a marketing strategy — to manage public image. The phenomenon is well known in the venture capital (VC) community. Normally a company would only operate in stealth mode for the first couple of years. As investors may have to disclose funding a stealth startup, their names are made public, but often only a general summary description is known about the company. ""Most entrepreneurs say they are in stealth because they are worried about competitors stealing their ideas. This can be a risk if you have such a simple idea that just by hearing it, someone can replicate it.""​",3,0,"[10 / 11 / 2022]
